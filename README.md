# About

This is a sub-mod for CK2's Historical Immersion Project that adds new cultures and religions.

This mod is NOT historical and does NOT change any aspect of a regular CK2+HIP game.
It requires CHEATS or RULER DESIGNER to set the new culture and religions to your characters, when you want to use them.

It's intended purpose is to be used in alternative history scenarios.
